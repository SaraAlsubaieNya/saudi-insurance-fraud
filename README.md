##Saudi Insurance Fraud Data Analytics Project
##Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Saudi insurance fraud data. The main goal is to uncover patterns and insights that could help in understanding fraudulent behaviors in the insurance sector. The workflow includes data exploration and analysis using Snowflake, followed by data visualization and dashboard development using Streamlit.

##Tools Used
Snowflake: For data storage, querying, and processing.
Streamlit: For building an interactive web-based dashboard to visualize findings.
Python: For scripting and connecting Snowflake to Streamlit.

##Dataset
The dataset simulates real insurance fraud records. Since real patient or customer data is sensitive, a synthetic dataset was generated using the faker library to maintain privacy while preserving the structure and logic of actual insurance records.
